- [MATH 407](https://math.washington.edu/courses/2020/winter/math/407/a): Linear Optimization, taught by [Patrick Perkins](https://math.washington.edu/people/patrick-perkins). 
- [MATH 407](https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/ddrusv/teaching): Nonlinear Optimization, taught by [Dmitriy Drusvyatskiy](https://math.washington.edu/people/dmitriy-drusvyatskiy).
- [MATH 409](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~rothvoss/409-spring-2022/409-spring-2022.html): Discrete Optimization, taught by [Thomas Rothvoss](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~rothvoss/).

I hope the following resources benefit those interested, or any self learners.
